<a href = "https://cleanpoweralliance.org/">Clean Power Alliance</a> currently serves commercial and residential customers in thirty member jurisdictions and the unincorporated portions of Los Angeles and Ventura Counties, shown in teal below.  In these places, customers are autmatically enrolled to receive electricity from Clean Power Alliance.  Each jurisdiction has a default percentage of electricity coming from renewable energy sources, either 36%, 50% or 100%.  Customers have the option of opting-up to a higher percentage of their electricity coming from renewable energy sources, opting-down, or opting out entirely and receiving their electricity exclusively from Southern California Edison.  Clean Power Alliance purchases renewable energy and delivers it via the grid maintained by Southern California Edison.
